Final
Objectives
- Create a full-fledged Web Application using node.js Express web server using various front-end and back-end technologies

This program is designed to create a sneaker enthusiasts' website to provide news, information, and history about dunks specifically.
Many sneaker websites covered sneaker culture the same format. Therefore, this app was to create a more personal and creative take on 
the sneaker culture, highlighting its artistic elements more than its commercial value.

Some minor issues I encountered were 
- setting up the routes
- properly configuring the post-route
- how to use Ajax with jQuery
- convert the json response into dynamic html content
- make navigation bar fixed to the top of the page
- scroll effect in nagatiob bar
- relative and absolute positioning
- how to display a transparent image 
- rotating and scaling an image to fit in an absolute div
- web scraping dealing with lazy loading images
- dynamically filling a grid with different orientations
- flexbox layout in general
